# Clustering 3D probability density functions 

This package implements a clustering algorithm based on Fuzzy Clustering, k-mean, k-medoids and possibilistic c-mean, specifically designed for 3D gaussian distributions. This method is particularly effective for applications involving uncertain or overlapping data boundaries.

# Installation

To use this package, simply clone the repository and integrate the MATLAB code into your project. Ensure that you have the necessary MATLAB toolboxes (e.g., Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox) installed to run the Gaussian probability functions. This code is compatible with MATLAB 2024b but can also be used with Octave.
